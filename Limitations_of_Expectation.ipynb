    "What is the optimal distance $z$ the competitors should use to decide whether to rethrow their javelin? I would assume that the value of $z$ which maximises the expected throw length would be the answer. After all, that would mean _on average_ your throw will be as long as possible. This can be calculated as a function of $z$, where the competitor's attempt is represented by the Random Variable $X$:\n",

Thus the strategy to maximise the expected throw length is to rethrow the javelin if it fails to surpass the halfway mark. Sounds sensible. Furthermore, the expected value is calculated simply by passing the value $z = \\frac{1}{2}$ into the function for $\\mathbb{E}(X)$, and is equal to $ \\frac{5}{8} = 0.625 $. \n"
